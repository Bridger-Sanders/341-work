# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo.
## Bridger Sanders
I'm taking Web Design because it is a required course under the B.F.A. checklist. Besides that reason, I've taken MART 120 - Creative Coding, so I'm somewhat familiar with what I'm getting myself into. Honestly, I find coding tedious and straining, but it's not a bad skill to have under my belt.
- I learned that the internet and World Wide Web are two different things that work together.
- I learned that files that are sent via internet are divided and restored upon delivery.
- I learned that computers are not directly connected to the internet, however they can be connected through internet providers.
- Also, website data is stored on servers connected to the internet.
