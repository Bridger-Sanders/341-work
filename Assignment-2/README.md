# Assignment 2
## Version Controls Systems
- A version control system gives developers the ability to keep the history of changes they've made to a file.
- It also allows them to make changes, compare the change before and after it was made, as well as revert back to a previous commit.
- Sharing and working on a file with others is child's play with version control.
- Everyone who is collaborating on a file can view as well as edit each others work.
