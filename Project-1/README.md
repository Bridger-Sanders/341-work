- B.) Google Chrome - it's quick and tabs are easy to sift through, though having too many tabs open at once really puts a damper on my computer.

  1. I went to ubl.com (Ultimate Band List 1996 - 2018).
  2. It seemed fairly simple to start out with, white page with text on it, the title was really the only thing that was artistic.

- D.)
  1. I read through Module Project 1: Topic 3 then made an index and readme.
  2. I'm having trouble getting my live site to have a link to my project-1. I'm still trying to figure out the problem.
  3. I don't think there is anything I want to discuss further.
  4. I won't post my problem to the issues repo, and I didn't help anyone with their problems.
